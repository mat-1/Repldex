Repldex is the unofficial community-editable encyclopedia of user created entries for the [Replit Discord Server](https://replit.com/discord). This repository contains the entire source code for both the website and the slash command Discord bot. Repldex uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and is hosted serverlessly on [Vercel](https://vercel.app/).
