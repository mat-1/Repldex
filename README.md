If the change you'd like to make is simple enough such as fixing a tpyo, you can simply fork the repo, edit the file using GitHub's online editor, and make a pull request.
Otherwise, use the following instructions:

1. Fork the repository with Git.
2. Navigate to the directory in your terminal and run `npm i` to install the necessary packages.
3. Create your Discord bot at the [Discord Developer Portal applications page](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
4. Create a MongoDB database. (Tip: use [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) for a free database).
5. Rename the [.env.example](.env.example) file to .env and fill in the fields.
6. Make your changes, run `npm run dev` to open your server at `http://localhost:3000`. This will automatically update as you change your code.
7. Once you're satisfied with your changes, create a commit and make a [pull request](https://github.com/repldex/Repldex/pulls).
